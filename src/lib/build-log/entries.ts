I wrote the first pass in two days — from \"an agent is a function\" to \"the whole thing in 60 lines.\" Pyodide handles Python in WebAssembly. React Flow renders animated architecture diagrams. A custom trace pipeline shows every HTTP call and tool dispatch in real time.",

        body: "The first version used Mermaid.js for diagrams. They looked fine but couldn't animate. Ripped it all out and replaced with React Flow — now the diagram highlights nodes as code executes. Same day: added the trace parser, the monitor panel, the step-by-step prose column. Deployed to Railway by end of day.",

Each lesson has interactive code you run in the browser, a live architecture diagram, and a monitor showing the raw HTTP traffic. Mock LLM mode for people without API keys.",

This reframed the entire product. The prose is the main character. The code playground is a bonus. I added auto-run on the first step, TRY ME nudges on sample chips, and dopamine toasts when you complete a lesson.",

Comments are algorithm fuel on LinkedIn. 14 comments in the first hour pushed Post 1 to 2nd and 3rd degree connections. Zero comments killed Post 2 in the feed. Also learned: title cards kill watch time (17s vs 12s average). Open with code on screen, not a label.",

Every piece of content that performed was written in my own voice. Raw, opinionated, slightly rough. The lesson: own voice beats AI copy for distribution. Use AI for code, not for posts.",

The posting is the thing. This personal brand transfers directly to my main company when it comes out of stealth. Honest self-assessment at end of week: effort 8/10, effectiveness 5/10. The gap was user conversations — 11K views and zero real conversations with users.",
