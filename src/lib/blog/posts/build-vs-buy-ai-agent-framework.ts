      heading: "The build-vs-buy question for AI agents",
      body: `Every team building with LLMs faces this decision: do you use a framework like LangChain, CrewAI, or AutoGen — or write it yourself? The marketing says frameworks save weeks of development time. The Reddit threads say they add complexity that takes weeks to debug. Both are right, depending on context.

The confusion exists because "AI agent framework" covers a huge range. Some frameworks are thin wrappers around API calls. Others are opinionated orchestration systems with their own execution model, memory layer, and deployment story. Choosing between them requires knowing what you are actually building. A single agent that calls GPT-4 with three tools and returns structured JSON is a fundamentally different engineering problem than a multi-agent system with shared memory, human-in-the-loop approval, and dynamic tool registration. The first is an afternoon of work. The second might justify a framework — or might justify a custom solution that fits your exact requirements without the framework's opinions about the parts you do not need.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "What frameworks actually give you",
      body: `Frameworks provide three categories of value. First: wiring. They connect your code to LLM providers, vector stores, and external APIs through unified interfaces. LangChain supports swapping between OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and local models by changing one parameter. If you genuinely need multi-provider support — not "might need someday" but "we switch between providers based on cost and latency in production" — this saves real engineering time. The provider APIs are similar but not identical, and edge cases around streaming, tool calling formats, and error handling differ in ways that are tedious to abstract yourself.

Second: patterns. Pre-built implementations of the agent loop, tool calling, memory management, and guardrails. This is where most teams get burned. The agent loop is a while loop. Tool calling is a dict lookup. Conversation memory is a list. These patterns are simple enough that the framework's abstraction often costs more than it saves — you spend time learning the framework's API for something you could write in twenty lines.

Third: ecosystem. Observability tools like LangSmith, deployment platforms like LangServe, and community recipes. This is real value, but it creates lock-in. Once your traces live in LangSmith and your deployment runs on LangServe, switching costs are high. Evaluate whether you want that coupling before you adopt it.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "The hidden cost of framework abstractions",
      body: `LangChain's AgentExecutor is a while loop that calls the LLM, checks for tool requests, dispatches them, and repeats. Its ConversationBufferMemory is a Python list that appends messages. Its @tool decorator registers a function in a dictionary. These are not complex patterns. When you wrap them in framework abstractions, you inherit specific costs that compound over time.

First, you get the framework's error messages instead of Python's. When a tool call fails inside AgentExecutor, the stack trace passes through multiple framework layers before reaching your code. Debugging goes from "read the traceback" to "search the docs for which internal class raised this exception." Second, you inherit the framework's update cycle. LangChain has shipped breaking changes in minor versions. Your agent that worked on Monday breaks on Wednesday because a dependency updated. Third, you inherit the framework's opinions about patterns you might want differently. Want to add custom retry logic between tool calls? You need to subclass or monkey-patch rather than editing your own while loop.

The practical test: if you cannot explain what the framework is doing at the API level — what HTTP requests it sends, what JSON it constructs — you do not understand your own system. That is a liability in production.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "When to build from scratch",
      body: `Build from scratch when the thing you are building is simpler than the framework's simplest example. Your agent calls GPT-4 with three tools and returns structured JSON. You do not need fourteen pip install dependencies for that. You need the openai package, a dict of functions, and a while loop.

Build from scratch when you are prototyping and need to move fast. Learning a framework's API, understanding its abstractions, and debugging its error messages is overhead that slows down the iteration cycle when you are still figuring out what your agent should do. Write the raw API calls, get the behavior right, then decide if a framework helps.

Build from scratch when your team needs to understand and debug every line. In production, the agent that breaks at 2 AM needs to be fixable by whoever is on call. If that person has to read LangChain source code to understand why the agent is stuck in a loop, you have a problem.

Build from scratch when you are building something the framework was not designed for. Custom control flow, non-standard memory patterns, or domain-specific tool orchestration often fight the framework's assumptions rather than benefiting from them. The core agent pattern — tool calling, the loop, conversation history, memory — is roughly sixty lines of Python. That is less code than most framework quickstart tutorials.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "When to use a framework",
      body: `Use a framework when the integrations justify the dependency. If you need a RAG pipeline with PDF chunking, embedding generation via OpenAI's API, storage in Pinecone, and retrieval with reranking via Cohere — LangChain's document loaders, text splitters, and retriever abstractions save you from writing and maintaining each integration yourself. That is four external services with four different APIs, authentication schemes, and error modes. The framework has already handled the edge cases.

Use a framework when you need production-grade observability and your team does not want to build it. LangSmith gives you trace visualization, cost tracking, and evaluation harnesses out of the box. Building equivalent tooling yourself is a significant engineering investment. If observability is a hard requirement and you are not a platform team, this is real value.

Use a framework when you are building complex multi-agent workflows. If you have agents that delegate to other agents, share state through a blackboard pattern, and need human-in-the-loop approval at specific steps — AutoGen and CrewAI have battle-tested implementations of these patterns. Reimplementing agent-to-agent communication, shared memory coordination, and workflow orchestration from scratch is a project in itself.

Use a framework when your team already knows it and the abstractions match your mental model. Familiarity has real value. A team that ships with LangChain in a week beats a team that spends two weeks building from scratch, even if the custom solution is technically cleaner.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "The best approach: understand first, then decide",
      body: `The teams that succeed with AI agents — whether using frameworks or not — are the ones that understand the fundamentals before choosing their tools. If you know that an agent is a function that calls an LLM in a loop, that tools are a dictionary mapping names to functions, and that memory is a list of messages you manage yourself, you can evaluate any framework honestly.

You will know what LangChain's AgentExecutor is doing because you have written the same while loop yourself. You will know whether CrewAI's task delegation adds value for your use case because you understand the underlying message-passing pattern. You will know when AutoGen's conversation patterns are worth the abstraction because you have implemented simpler versions by hand.

This is not an argument against frameworks. It is an argument against adopting them before you understand what they abstract. The build-vs-buy decision is easy once you know what you are buying. If the framework saves you from writing and maintaining code you understand but do not want to own, that is a good trade. If the framework hides complexity you do not understand, that is technical debt disguised as productivity. The first step is always the same: understand the fundamentals, then decide.`,
